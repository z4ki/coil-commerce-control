## Overview
Create a comprehensive sold products analytics page with advanced filtering, analytics, and export features, following best practices for UX, performance, and accessibility.

---

## 1. Page Structure & Design
- [x] Reuse existing app layout, header, sidebar, and theming
- [x] Ensure accessibility (keyboard, ARIA labels)
- [x] Support dark mode
- [ ] Add breadcrumb navigation

---

## 2. Core Features & Priority Enhancements

### Phase 1: Core Improvements

  - [ ] Payment Status Filter (All/Paid/Unpaid, visual indicators)
  - [ ] Product Grade Filter (Precision/Heavy Duty/Automotive/Industrial)
  - [ ] Multi-select for clients/products
  - [ ] Global Search Bar (product/client/invoice)
  - [ ] Auto-suggestions as you type
  - [ ] Recent Searches & Saved Filter Sets
- [x] **Table Enhancements**
  - [x] Data table with all key columns
  - [x] Table rendering with real data
  - [ ] Column customization (show/hide, reorder)
  - [ ] Multi-column sorting
  - [ ] Export enhancements (custom/filtered export)

### Phase 2: Visualizations
- [ ] **Interactive Charts**
  - [ ] Sales Trend Chart (timeline)
  - [ ] Weight Distribution by Product Type
  - [ ] Revenue by Client (pie/donut)
  - [ ] Thickness Distribution (histogram)
  - [ ] Monthly/Quarterly Performance
  - [ ] Top 10 Products by Weight/Revenue
  - [ ] Client Performance Comparison
- [ ] **Visual Enhancements**
  - [ ] Sparklines in summary cards
  - [ ] Progress bars in table cells
  - [ ] Color coding (payment status, product grades, etc.)
  - [ ] Conditional formatting (highlight high-value, overdue, etc.)
  - [ ] Comparison views (period, client, product)

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
- [ ] **Saved Filter Sets**
- [ ] **Predictive Analytics** (trend predictions, client behavior, inventory/revenue forecasting)
- [ ] **Performance Insights** (best/worst products, client performance, growth metrics)
- [ ] **Mobile Optimization**

### Phase 4: Polish & Optimization
- [ ] **Performance Optimization** (virtual scroll, caching, progressive loading, background refresh)
- [ ] **Advanced Export Options** (scheduled/email reports, multiple formats, print/share, report templates)
- [ ] **Keyboard Shortcuts & Bulk Actions**
- [ ] **Final UI/UX Polish**

## 3. Backend Implementation

- [x] Use `sale_items` for all product types (with `product_type` column)
- [ ] Add indexes on filter columns if needed (date, product_type, client_id, etc.)
- [x] Implement and test enhanced Tauri commands:
  - [x] `get_sold_products_analytics` (with basic filters, error handling)
  - [x] `get_sold_products_summary` (aggregated stats)
  - [ ] `get_analytics_charts_data` (for all chart types)
  - [ ] `get_comparative_analytics` (period comparison)
  - [ ] `get_client_performance` (client trends)
- [ ] Return total count for paginated queries
- [ ] Optionally cache summary stats
- [x] Strict input validation & rate limiting (basic)

---

## 4. Frontend Implementation

- [x] **State Management**
  - [x] Global loading/error state
  - [x] Optimistic UI and loading skeletons
- [x] **API Service**
  - [x] TypeScript types for all API responses
  - [x] Error boundaries for graceful error display
- [x] **Component Structure**
  - [x] Modular filter, summary card, table components
  - [ ] AdvancedFilterPanel.tsx
  - [ ] ChartsContainer.tsx
  - [ ] ComparisonView.tsx
  - [ ] ExportModal.tsx
  - [ ] TableCustomization.tsx
  - [ ] SavedFilters.tsx
  - [ ] PerformanceInsights.tsx
- [x] **User Experience**
  - [x] Responsive design (mobile/tablet/desktop)
  - [x] Table virtualization for large datasets (basic)
  - [x] Accessibility (high-contrast, screen reader support)
  - [ ] Keyboard shortcuts, bulk actions, row details

---

## 5. Technical Requirements

- [x] Debounced API calls for filters (basic)
- [x] Infinite scroll or pagination (basic)
- [ ] Prefetch next page of results
- [x] Unit, integration, and E2E tests (basic)
- [x] Component and API documentation (basic)
